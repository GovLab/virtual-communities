                <p>The Governance Lab's mission is to improve people's lives by changing the way we govern. Our goal at
                    The GovLab is to strengthen the ability of institutions — including but not limited to governments —
                    and people to work more openly, collaboratively, effectively, and legitimately to make better
                    decisions and solve public problems. We believe that increased availability and use of data, new
                    ways to leverage the capacity, intelligence, and expertise of people in the problem-solving process,
                    combined with new advances in technology and science, can transform governance. We approach each
                    challenge and opportunity in an interdisciplinary, collaborative way, irrespective of the problem,
                    sector, geography, and level of government. For more information, visit thegovlab.org.</p>
